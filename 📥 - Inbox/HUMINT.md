Human Intelligence. “Old school” intelligence collection done using human sources. However, OSINT super-charges this and gives the investigator a huge advantage when interviewing a source. It’s a natural, valuable add-on to any OSINT investigation.

“OSINT is the secret power behind many HUMINT collection wins, providing the context to get a person to do something they’re not supposed to do. Often with the right OSINT information, it’s possible to get someone who is aware they hold sensitive information to either grant you access because they think they are supposed to, or because they think you already know the information they have access to.”
