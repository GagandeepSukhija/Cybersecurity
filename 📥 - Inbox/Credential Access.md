MITRE Tactic TA0006 - https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/

This works together with [[Privilege Escalation]], the attacker attempts to steal account names and passwords using various methods. This could include keylogging and [[Credential Dumping]]. Gaining credentials allows the attacker to operate covertly for longer as theyâ€™re using legitimate credentials, therefore, being harder to detect.
