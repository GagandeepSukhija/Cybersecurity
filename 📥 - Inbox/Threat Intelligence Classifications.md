Threat Intel is geared towards understanding the relationship between your operational environment and your attacker. With this in mind intel can be divided into the following:

Strategic Intel:
High level intel that looks at the org’s threat landscape and maps out the risk areas. This is based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that could impact business decisions.

Technical Intel:
Looks at the evidence and artefacts of an attack used by an adversary. IR teams use this to create a baseline attack surface to analyse it and develop defense mechanisms.

Tactical Intel:
Assesses the attackers’ [[TTPs]]. This strengthens security controls and addresses vulns with real-time investigations.

Operational Intel:
Looks into their motives and intent to perform the attack. Security teams use this to understand the critical assets available in the org (People, processes and tech) that could be potential targets.
