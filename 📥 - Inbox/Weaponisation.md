MITRE TA0001:
https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/

An attacker creates a [[Weaponiser]]. Most attackers usually use automated tools to generate the malware or purchase it off the DarkWeb. Sophisticated attackers or nation-sponsored APTs would can write their custom malware to make the malware sample unique and evade detection on the target.

In this Phase the attacker would:
- Create an Infected MS Office document with a malicious macro or [[VBA]] scripts.
- Create Sophisticated worm on a USB and then distribute them in public.
- Choose C2 techniques to execute commands on the victimâ€™s device to deliver more payloads.
- Select a backdoor implant (how to access the system and bypassing security mechanisms)

In the UKC, it also describes the setting up of necessary infrastructure to perform the attack like a C2, a system capable of catching reverse shells and delivering payloads.
