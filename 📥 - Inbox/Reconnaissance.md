MITRE TA0043:
https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/

Discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim. [[OSINT]] (Open Source Intelligence) also falls under reconnaissance and is the first step an attacker needs to complete to carry out the next phases of the attack.


In the UKC:
- Discovering what systems and services are running on the target.
- Finding contact lists or lists of employees that can be impersonated/used for social engineering or a phishing attack.
- Looking for potential credentials that may be of use later, for pivoting or initial access.
- Understanding the network topology and other systems on it that can be pivoted too.
