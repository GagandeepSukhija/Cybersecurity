One of the main HTTP methods used by web clients (browsers/scripts) to send data to a server. This is often used when submitting a form, uploading a file or using an API. In other words, whenever you’re sending some data to a server.

Logging In (username, password), Registering a user (user info to a form), Posting a comment (text), Uploading a file (sending the data), API Interaction (Sending JSON to an endpoint).

It’s less visible than [[GET Request]]s, but isn’t encrypted unless HTTPS is used.
