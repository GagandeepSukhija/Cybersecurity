There are many open source tools used to identify whether an IP address is considered safe or not by checking its reputation. These tools can also give an indication of their location. Most security analysts use these tools to aid them with alert investigations. As a security analyst, you too can help make the internet safer by reporting these malicious IPs on these sites. Once you know an IP address is malicious, you can escalate it to another staff member.
