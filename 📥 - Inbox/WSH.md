Windows Script Host Engine. Allows VBScript or JScript to run directly on Windows systems outside of a browser or other applications. This can be used to create/delete files, read/write to the registry, launch programs, automate sysadmin tasks, interact with Windows components like FileSystemObject, WMI or network shares. PowerShell serves as a replacement for this with more security features but can’t do anything [[VBScript]] related since that’s deprecated. So although it isn’t a full replacement, it can serve pretty much the same purpose.
