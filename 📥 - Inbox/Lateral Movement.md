MITRE Tactic TA0008 - https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/

According to [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/lateral-movement/), **lateral movement** refers to the techniques that a malicious actor uses after gaining initial access to the victim's machine to move deeper into a network to obtain sensitive data.

UKC:
Moving through the networks with the credentials theyâ€™ve obtained to jump onto other targeted systems to achieve their primary objective. The stealthier the technique used, the better.
