As defined by [[The Diamond Model]]:

The target of the adversary. This could be a person, organisation, email address, IP address, domain etc. 

A victim can be an opportunity to get a foothold on the organisation they’re trying to attack, there’s always a victim in every cyberattack.

The model differentiates between a Victim _Persona_ and Victim _Assets_:
- [[Victim Personae]]
- [[Victim Assets]]
