# Overview:
A military concept that defines the structure of an attack used by adversaries. Lockheed Martin established the framework for the cybersecurity industry in 2011. To succeed, the attacker would need to go through all the phases of the Kill Chain. 

Understanding how the Kill Chain works will help you better protect against ransomware attacks, security breaches and APTs. You can use the Kill Chain to assess your network and system security by identifying missing controls and closing certain security gaps based on the company’s infrastructure. Furthermore, by understanding the chain as an SOC Analyst, Security Researcher, Threat Hunter or Incident Responder; you’ll be able to better recognise the intrusion attempts and understand the intruder’s goals and objectives. 

By understanding the Kill Chain and being able to identify where an attacker is in the Kill Chain, you’ll know how to break it.

# The Cyber Kill Chain:
1) [[Reconnaissance]]
2) [[Weaponisation]]
3) [[Delivery]]
4) “Exploitation” - [[Execution]]
5) Installation, [[Persistence]]
6) Command & Control ([[C2]])
7) Actions on Objectives ([[Exfiltration]])


# Note:
CISA recommends to use the Unified Kill Chain in conjunction with MITRE ATT&CK. Furthermore, the Kill Chain doesn’t cover insider threats using their authorised access to harm the organisation.

# Target Case Study:
19/12/2013, Target released a statement confirming the breach, stating that approx. 40M credit and debit card accounts were impacted between 27/11/2013-15/12/2013. Target had to pay a fine of $18.5M under the terms of the multistate settlement agreement.
