The hierarchy in how domains are organised.

![[a168c8511887fff98a6944619c4b5259.png]]

Root Level Domains:
- The “root” level domain is the “.”


Top Level Domains:
- The top level domains are the right-most part of a domain name, for example, .com, .gov etc.
- Top Level Domains have 2 types: gTLD (Generic Top Level) and ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain). Historically, a gTLD is to tell the user the domain name’s purpose f.e. .com for commercial purposes, .gov for government, .org for organisation etc. 
- ccTLDs are for geographical purposes f.e. .ca for canada, .co.uk for United Kingdom.
- Since there was so much demand, new gTLDs have been introduced. This is a full list:

Second-Level Domains:
- Using “tryhackme.com” as an example, “tryhackme” is the 2nd level domain. 
- The 2nd level domain is limited to 63 characters, a-z, 0-9 and hyphens (cannot be at the start or end, cannot have consecutive hyphens). 

Subdomains:
- On the left hand side of the second level domain with a period to separate it. f.e. “admin.tryhackme.com”, where “admin” is the subdomain.
- A subdomain name has the same restrictions of 63 characters etc, however, these can be chained with periods to create longer names but with a limit of 253 characters.
