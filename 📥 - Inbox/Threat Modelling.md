“A series of steps to ultimately improve the security of a system. Threat modelling is about identifying risk”. - THM.

Overview of Threat Modelling:
- Identifying what systems and applications need to be secured and the function they serve. This involves identifying what’s critical to normal operations and what holds sensitive information.
- Assessing what vulnerabilities and weaknesses these systems and applications may have and how these could be potentially exploited.
- Creating a plan to secure these from the highlighted vulns.
- Creating and enforcing policies that prevent these vulns from occurring again where possible. F.e. implementing a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for an application, or training employees.

Threat modelling is an important procedure to reduce risk within systems and application. It’s power comes from creating high-level overviews of an organisation’s IT assets, allowing you to create effective procedures to resolve the vulns.

The [[Unified Kill Chain]] can encourage threat modelling as the UKC framework helps identify potential attack surfaces and how they could be exploited.

There are many frameworks for Threat Modelling, a few examples are:
- [[STRIDE]] - Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege. ()
- [[DREAD]] - System used by MS.
- [[CVSS]] - Common Vulnerability Scoring System
