“**Adversary Customer** is the entity that stands to benefit from the activity conducted in the intrusion. It may be the same person who stands behind the adversary operator, or it may be a separate person or group. 

As an example, an adversary customer could control different operators simultaneously. Each operator might have its capabilities and infrastructure.” - THM
