FIN7 is also known as Carbanak. It’s financially motivated and targets US-based companies in retail, restaurant and hospitality sectors since 2015. They’re known for using sophisticated techniques to move laterally inside networks with the goal of stealing payment card information. Researchers from the security firm Morphisec estimate that FIN7 members earn around $50M a month.
