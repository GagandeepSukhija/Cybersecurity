Visual Basic. VBA can automate tasks in MS Office, has UI support, has full access to Office object models. Unlike [[VBScript]], it isn’t deprecated. It can do almost anything the user can. This includes manipulating documents, databases, forms, spreadsheets, presentations, and the computer itself. This includes mouse clicks, key presses, opening dialog boxes, saving files, inputting data etc. VBA is built into Office.

It’s an object based language, however, the language works by taking advantage of the objects, methods, properties etc. that already exist in MS Office applications which the language can use.
