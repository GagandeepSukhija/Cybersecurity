MITRE Tactic TA0005 - https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/

This is one of the more valuable phases of the UKC. It is specifically to understand the techniques an adversary uses to evade defensive measures which have been implemented in the system/network f.e. web-app firewalls, network firewalls, anti-virus systems on the target endpoint, [[IDS & IPS]]. This phase is valuable when analysing an attack because it helps form a response and gives the defence team info on how they can improve their systems.
