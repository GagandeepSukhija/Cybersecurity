MITRE TA0001 - https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/

Techniques that an attacker can employ to manipulate employees to perform actions that will aid in the adversary’s attack. For example:
- Persuading a user to open a malicious attachment.
- Impersonating a webpage and credential farming.
- Calling/visiting the target and impersonating a user (f.e, requesting a password reset) or gaining access to areas of a site that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to (f.e. impersonating a utility engineer)
