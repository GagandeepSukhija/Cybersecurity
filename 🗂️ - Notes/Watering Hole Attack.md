A target designed to aim at at a specific group of people by compromising the website they are usually visiting. This then redirects them to a malicious website of the attackerâ€™s choice. The attacker could also encourage the victims to visit the website by sending emails pointing out the malicious URL to make the attack work more efficiently. The website could then download malware/malicious application onto their computer. This is also called a drive-by download.
