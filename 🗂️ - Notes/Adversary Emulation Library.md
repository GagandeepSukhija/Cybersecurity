A public library for adversary emulation plans which is a free resource for blue/red teamers. It’s a contribution by the [[CTID]]. The plans are a step-by-step guide on how to mimic the specific [[APT]]. If a C-Suite were to ask “"how would we fare if APT29 hits us?" This can easily be answered by referring to the results of the execution of the emulation plan.” - THM.
