Advanced Persistent Threat Groups. These are teams/groups (threat groups) or even countries (nation-state groups). They engage in long term attacks against organisations or countries. APT’s aren’t necessarily “advanced” in their techniques, the techniques they use are often quite common and can be detected with the right implementations.
