“MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.” - MITRE ATT&CK

In 2013, MITRE began to address the need to record and document common [[TTPs]] that [[APT]] groups used against enterprise Windows networks. This lead to an internal project known as FMX “Fort Meade Experiment”. Security professionals were tasked to emulated TTPs against a network and then data was collected from the attacks on this network. This data helped construct the beginning pieces of is now the ATT&CK framework.

It’s grown throughout the years and one of the most notable expansions is its expanded to other platforms like macOS and Linux. Many sources now contribute to the framework such as security researchers and threat intelligence reports. However, this isn’t a tool just for blue teamers and it’s also useful for red teamers.

You can use the site to get details on TTPs and their associated mitigations with an example attack overview using the technique. The ATT&CK Navigator is another tool used to map out an attack. This is designed to be generic and an easy to use tool to do such things.
