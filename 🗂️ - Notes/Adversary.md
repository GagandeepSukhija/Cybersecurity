As defined by [[The Diamond Model]]:
The actor/organisation behind the cyberattack. The one’s responsible for utilising a capability against the victim to achieve their intent.

For most events at the time of discovery, knowledge of the adversary is usually empty since they’re difficult to identify during the first stages of a cyberattack until further research is done. Using data collected from an incident/breach such as signatures and other relevant information can give you clues to determine who they are.

This model makes a distinction between an _[[Adversary Operator]]_ and an _[[Adversary Customer]]_.
