“_The MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK_ ®  _adversary model. CAR defines a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode representations but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools (e.g., Splunk, EQL) in its analytics. With respect to coverage, CAR is focused on providing a set of validated and well-explained analytics, in particular with regards to their operating theory and rationale._” - MITRE, https://car.mitre.org/
