The [[TTPs]] attributed to the adversary. Using threat intel as defenders we can make better decisions to formulate a more powerful defensive strategy. Large corps might have an in-house team whose primary objective is to gather threat intel for other teams in the org. This also includes using intel that is already public, some can be open source or through a subscription with a vendor like Crowdstrike. 

On the other hand, many defenders wear multiple hands (roles) within some orgs so they need to take time from their other tasks for threat intel. For the latter, ATT&CK can be used because the goal of Threat Intel is to make the information _actionable_.

Threat Intel Room:
Analysis of data and information to generate meaningful patterns on how to mitigate potential risks associated with existing or _emerging_ threats targeting orgs, industries, sectors or governments.

To mitigate this you can ask the following:
- Who's attacking you?
- What's their motivation?
- What are their capabilities?
- What artefacts and indicators of compromise should you look out for?
